                <p>Hello!</p> 
                <p>I’m a data scientist with an MS in statistics and a commitment for ensuring model appropriateness, validity and performance. In my view, this starts with understanding the question of interest and the data being used to answer it.   </p>
                <p>In my 5 years working in scientific research, I have honed the ability to holistically understand a specific question within a complex context, write and speak clearly, and use computational tools (Python, R, Docker, Linux and AWS/HPCs) effectively. I bring both a big picture perspective and an eye for the details. </p>
                <p>Outside of work, I enjoy cooking fresh veggies, walking and reading.</p>
                <p>I'm currently seeking opportunities for my next full time role. </p>
